"Time Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) Assay: The inhibition of p53-MDM2 and p53-MDM4 interactions is measured by time resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET). Fluorescence energy transfer (or Foerster resonance energy transfer) describes an energy transfer between donor and acceptor fluorescent molecules. For this assay, human MDM2 protein (amino acids 2-188) and human MDM4 protein (amino acids 2-185), tagged with a C-terminal biotin moiety, are used in combination with a Europium labeled streptavidin (Perkin Elmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) serving as the donor fluorophore. The p53 derived, Cy5 labeled peptide Cy5-TFSDLWKLL (p53 aa18-26) is the energy acceptor.

Recombinant, truncated, human, N-terminal GST-MDM2 (aa 1-150) was obtained from GeneScript. Wild-type, full length human N-terminal 6-his p53 was purchased from SignalChem.Resulting in a final reaction volume of 24 μl PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, and 10% glycerol, 30 ng of MDM2 was added, followed by the addition of 10 of compound diluted in 100% DMSO that provided a final DMSO concentration of 4%. 30 ng of p53 was then added, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Glutathione donor beads and Nickel acceptor beads (0.5 μg each; PerkinElmer) were added under subdued lighting conditions to a final reaction volume of 30 μl/well in a 96 well, ½ volume Proxima plate.",,2015,CHEMBL5023,p53-binding protein Mdm-2,CHEMBL3703679,IC50,nM,Cc1cc(Cl)cnc1NC(c1ccc2cccnc2c1O)c1c(F)c(F)c(OCC(F)(F)F)c(F)c1F,8500.0,5.070581074285707,545.8420000000003,6.9962200000000045,2.0,5.0
